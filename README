=> INSTRUCTIONS:

The source code is in:
project2.scala file located at: project2>src>main>scala

To start:
	1. Go to the project directory: project2>
	2. Run: sbt clean compile "run <number of nodes> <topology> <algorithm>"
	
	where: 
		<topology> = line, 3d, imp3d, full
		<algorithm> = gossip, push-sum
	Example: sbt clean compile "run 100 line push-sum"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> What is Working ?
	1. Each permutation of (topology, algorithm) is working
	2. (ticker) Checks are put in place to NOT increment self counter if
	   message is received from self 
	3. Cnvergence of the system as a whole might not be reached in some
	   cases where for a node, all neighbors are shut down, BECAUSE of
	   point #2 above. In such cases, convergence time of the system
	   would be the convergence time of the last converged node at any
	   point
	4. (bonus) Checks are put in place to NOT send message to dead
	   neighbors
	   
=> What is the largest network we managed to deal with for each type of
   topology and algorithm ?
